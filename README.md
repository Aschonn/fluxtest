# Flux Homelab

For this setup I used terraform from my homelab to setup up the node. I will be creating a barebones k3s cluster with all the basic necessarities (infrastructure, monitoring, storage, etc..) to have a functioning gitops repo and cluster. This includes https certificates generated via dns from cloudflare. By the end of this tutorial you should have a functioning cluster with visability to boot local via your network.

Ps. I used local DNS in order for this to work. I used Technitium DNS which is an open source dhcp server that can be installed using if interested:
